        <h3>Greetings</h3> 
        <p>Welcome to my chemistry wizard game! I made this as part of a chemistry independent study for college. I wanted to design a series of educational chemistry puzzles to be played through in game form. My organic chemistry professor, Dr. Kabrhel, helped me brainstorm, design, and check the accuracy of the puzzles. Hopefully this will be helpful to you as a review, or at the very least an enjoyable and somewhat educational experience.</p>
        <p>*Please Note: this is an early version and the game is still under development, I hope to add more puzzles over time.</p>
